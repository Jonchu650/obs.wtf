Thanks for downloading my basic bot package! The purpose of this package is to help already midly experienced js developers get started with discord.js faster.
This package provides the tools you need to create a functioning discord bot. This includes a command handler.

Command handlers are used to seperate your command code into seperate files. To use this command handler, make a copy of the template.js file inside the commands folder. Rename this file to your commands name.
The code of your command goes inside the run function. The module exports already provide your client, arguments and message. Please visit discordjs.guide for more information on creating commands.

If you have any questions about this package or the code in it, chat with myself and others on my discord server's code help channel. (https://discord.gg/vZM4fXR)

To run the bot, first make sure you have entered your token inside of .env, then open the run.bat file in your file explorer (Not in VSC).

Enjoy the package!
